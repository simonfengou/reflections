When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working with a group you should use remote repository.  Proprietary should be done locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Much like manually deciding when to commit, manually deciding allows user to make decisions on logical stops.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork = cloning from another repository, but in a way that allows linking back to original repository. Cloning is copying entire repository. Branches are creating new versions within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can anticipate what kind of merge is needed to sync up again.
