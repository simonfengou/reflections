When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working with a group you should use remote repository.  Proprietary should be done locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Much like manually deciding when to commit, manually deciding allows user to make decisions on logical stops.
